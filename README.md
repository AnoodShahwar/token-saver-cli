# 🔐 Token Saver CLI

A simple, minimal command-line tool to save and view tokens using Python.  
Built as part of an **AI Lab exercise** to showcase key Python concepts in a real-world inspired project.

I was given 10 basic Python tasks to cover, like input/output, loops, lists, and dictionaries.  
Instead of making a quiz or calculator, I thought of building a simple token saver — something that feels a bit more real and still checks all the boxes.  
It’s just a soft little CLI tool made purely for learning and practice ✨

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Save tokens with custom names  
- 🗂️ Optional tags like `github`, `openai`, `firebase`  
- 📜 View all saved tokens  
- ⌨️ Terminal-style commands: `add`, `view`, `exit`  
- 💡 Beginner-friendly logic using core Python concepts  

---

## 📚 Concepts Demonstrated

This project demonstrates:

- Input / Output  
- Variables  
- Operators (Arithmetic + Logical)  
- Lists / Tuples  
- Dictionaries  
- Conditional Statements (`if-else`)  
- Loops (`for`, `while`)  
- Terminal-style command simulation

## 💻 How to Run

You can run this in **two ways**:

### 🧪 Option 1: Jupyter Notebook  
Open and run `LAB_01_program.ipynb` in Jupyter. Each cell is labeled and outputs are shown inline.

### 🖥️ Option 2: Python Script  
Convert the notebook into a `.py` file and run it via terminal:

```bash
python token_saver.py
add     → Save a new token  
view    → View all saved tokens  
exit    → Exit the program
```

### 🌸 Final Note

This wasn’t just a lab exercise, it was my way of making Python feel real, useful, and a little bit fun.
I hope this tiny tool helps you learn the basics like it helped me build confidence 💻🌼
